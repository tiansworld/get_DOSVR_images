This is a script to download images collected by NASA DSCOVR's
Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument.

For more information, please go to: https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov

You are welcome to make improvement to this script. Because I am totally
a layman with very limited knowledge on programming, who happens to like
both IT and astronomy.
